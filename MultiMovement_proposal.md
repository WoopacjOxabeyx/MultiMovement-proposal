The name of the game is MultiMovement because It’s a combination of multiverse and movement

Level-based, Boss towers, Chase sequences

The game fits the genres because it is a fast-paced game where you dodge obstacles and shoot targets.

In the game, you don't just play as one character at a time. You play as 4 people in different universes. All 4 of these people are connected by some strange force and their actions and situations line up perfectly. They know about and can speak to each other, and they are all fighting a different enemy to find a way to stop this breach in the multiverse.

Younger people would be attracted to this because it is a fast paced game

Defeating the bosses and sharpening your skills with the characters will keep the player playing.

 My game will stand out by having movement mechanics that are smooth, varied, and quickly switchable, allowing for different playstyles

Titanfall 2 has some of the best movement mechanics of all time, and I will try and capture the smoothness that the movement brings. Team Fortress 2 has a class that is the second slowest runner in the game, but can rocket jump for bursts of speed and height that nobody else can achieve. This is a creative and interesting game mechanic, and I want to put it into my game to influence users to not be on the ground the whole time.

Ultrakill is the same way about movement, having many different ways to move around, with some being better in certain situations. My game, unlike Ultrakill, will be more focused on the movement aspect than combat.

I hope they feel satisfied and have fun by making them be able to pull off cool tricks, and rewarding the player for pulling them off.
